# AI Usage Notes

This document tracks how I leveraged various AI tools to accelerate development, improve code quality, and streamline the development workflow for the AI Studio application.

## Cursor - Primary Development Environment

**Test Case Generation & Test-Driven Development**

- Used Cursor's AI assistance to rapidly generate comprehensive test cases for React components
- Leveraged AI suggestions to write Playwright tests for critical user flows like style selection and image generation
- AI helped identify edge cases and boundary conditions I might have missed during manual testing
- Generated test data and mock objects to ensure robust test coverage

**Code Quality & Refactoring**

- AI-assisted refactoring of complex components like `ImageStudio` and `PreviewPanel`
- Real-time code suggestions for TypeScript type definitions and error handling
- Helped optimize performance-critical sections and identify potential memory leaks

## ChatGPT - Problem Solving & Architecture

**Technical Decision Making**

- Consulted ChatGPT when designing the state management architecture for the image generation workflow
- Used for brainstorming solutions to complex UI/UX challenges like lazy loading and error boundaries
- Helped evaluate trade-offs between different React patterns (Context vs Redux, hooks vs HOCs)

**Debugging & Troubleshooting**

- Shared error logs and stack traces to get targeted debugging advice
- Used for understanding complex React concepts like Suspense boundaries and error boundaries
- Helped troubleshoot TypeScript compilation issues and type inference problems

## Claude - Code Review & Documentation

**Code Review & Best Practices**

- Used Claude to review complex algorithms and data structures
- Got feedback on React performance optimization techniques
- Helped ensure accessibility compliance and semantic HTML structure

**Documentation & Knowledge Sharing**

- Assisted in writing clear, maintainable code comments
- Helped structure the component API documentation
- Generated examples for complex hook usage patterns

## Overall Workflow Impact

**Development Velocity**

- AI tools reduced initial development time by approximately 40-50%
- Faster iteration cycles due to AI-assisted debugging and testing
- More confident code changes with AI-powered code review

**Quality Improvements**

- Better test coverage through AI-suggested test scenarios
- Cleaner, more maintainable code with AI-assisted refactoring
- Fewer bugs in production due to AI-identified edge cases

**Learning & Growth**

- AI explanations helped deepen understanding of React patterns and TypeScript features
- Exposure to best practices and modern development techniques
- Faster onboarding to new concepts and libraries
